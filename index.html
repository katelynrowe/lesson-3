        <h2>1. Some boxes in a row.</h2>
          <p id="noline">Here’s a bunch of boxes floated next to each other with numbers in the middle, but two of them are special.

        <h2>2. This is a photo of a cat.</h2> 
          <p>Drop an image of a cat here that fills the width of this column. You’ll probably have to use something like <div id="monospace">width: 100%;</div>. And for that little guy, you’ll have to use something like <div id="monospace">font-family: monospace;.</div>

        <h2>3. This is a big link.</h2>
          <p>When you hover over it, it changes color. When you click it, it opens up Google in another tab. You don’t need to use a div for this. An a tag is an inline element, but you can make it a block element with css.
